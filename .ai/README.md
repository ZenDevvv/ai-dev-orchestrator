# AI-Assisted Fullstack Development Workflow

A 15-phase AI-assisted development workflow powered by Claude Code slash commands. Each phase automatically loads the right agent, skill documents, and context — no manual copy-pasting.

---

## How It Works

Every phase is a slash command. Type `/phase4b-backend-modules AUTH` and Claude Code automatically:

1. Adopts the Backend Engineer agent
2. Reads the MODULE_TEMPLATE.md skill doc
3. Reads your BRD and architecture doc for the AUTH module
4. Generates the module code

You review the output, make corrections, and move to the next phase.

## Sample Usage

```
/phase1-brd <your app concept or user stories>
/phase2-planning
/phase3-architecture
/phase4a-db-schema all
/phase4b-backend-modules <MODULE_NAME> | all
/phase5-backend-testing <MODULE_NAME> | all
/phase6-migrations
/phase7-ui-design <optional: design rules>
/phase8-frontend-api <MODULE_NAME>
/phase9-pages <PAGE_NAME>
/phase10-frontend-testing <MODULE_OR_PAGE_NAME>
/phase11-e2e
/phase12-review <optional: what to review>
/phase13-docs
/phase14-deployment

# Start any new session — re-orients Claude with project state, stale items, and next action:
/resume

# Mid-project requirement changes:
/phase-change add bulk CSV export to REPORTS — finance team needs it for audits
```

## Prerequisites

- **VSCode** with [Claude Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Anthropic.claude-code)
- A project idea to build

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo** into your workspace
2. **Open in VSCode** with Claude Code installed
3. **Run Phase 1**: type `/phase1-brd` followed by your app concept
4. **Review the BRD** carefully — it drives everything downstream
5. **Continue through phases** in order, using the slash commands

---

## Progress Tracking & Changes

Every phase automatically logs its completion to `docs/progress.md`:

```
| Phase | Name            | Scope       | Status      | Date       | Notes                            |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| 1     | BRD             | —           | ✅ Complete | 2026-02-18 | 5 modules, 32 requirements       |
| 2     | Planning        | —           | ✅ Complete | 2026-02-18 | 3 sprints, 4 risks flagged       |
| 4a    | DB Schema       | all         | ✅ Complete | 2026-02-19 | 6 models, prisma generate OK     |
| 4b    | Backend Module  | AUTH        | ✅ Complete | 2026-02-19 | Login, register, JWT             |
| 4b    | Backend Module  | USERS       | ✅ Complete | 2026-02-19 | CRUD + avatar upload             |
| 5     | Backend Testing | AUTH        | ⚠️ Stale   | 2026-02-19 | Tests OK | Stale: phase 4b AUTH re-run 2026-02-20 |
```

**Status values:**
- `✅ Complete` — phase finished and not invalidated by subsequent changes
- `⚠️ Stale` — phase was completed but a dependency was re-run or a change was logged that requires re-running this phase
- `🔄 Changed` — written by `/phase-change` to record a requirement change

Run `/resume` at the start of any session to see a summary of complete, stale, and pending phases — and the exact next command to run.

### Handling Mid-Project Changes

When requirements change or new features are added, use `/phase-change`:

```
/phase-change add bulk CSV export to REPORTS — finance team needs it for audits
```

This command:
1. **Updates the BRD** — adds or modifies requirements, never renumbers IDs
2. **Updates architecture** — if models or routes are affected
3. **Writes to `docs/changes.md`** — a timestamped change entry with:
   - What changed
   - Why (business context)
   - Which requirements/modules were affected
   - Exact phases that need re-running
4. **Logs to progress.md** — a `🔄 Changed` row
5. **Outputs an impact report** — so you know exactly what to action next

The `docs/changes.md` file is your audit trail — it answers "why does this exist?" months later.

## The 15 Phases

### Phase 1 — Business Requirements

```
/phase1-brd <your app concept or user stories>
```

Agent: Business Analyst | Skill: `BRD_FORMAT` | Output: `docs/brd.md`

Generates a complete BRD with module IDs, requirement IDs, Given/When/Then acceptance criteria, error states, **user stories**, and a **Page Manifest**. User stories map every user-facing interaction to a page — this becomes the source of truth for what Phase 7 designs and Phase 9 builds.

**Gate:** ⚠️ VERIFY — this document drives everything. Invest the most review time here.

---

### Phase 2 — Project Planning & Estimation

```
/phase2-planning
```

Agent: Project Manager | Skill: — | Reads: `docs/brd.md` | Output: `docs/project-plan.md`

Generates module breakdown, task estimates, sprint plan, dependency map, and risk register.

**Gate:** Review estimates and build order.

---

### Phase 3 — Architecture & Model Design

```
/phase3-architecture
```

Agent: Software Architect | Skill: `ARCHITECTURE_STANDARD` | Reads: `docs/brd.md`, `docs/project-plan.md` | Output: `docs/architecture.md`

Designs data models, ERD, API route map, auth strategy, and error standards. If `skills/ARCHITECTURE_STANDARD.md` doesn't exist yet, this phase creates it.

**Gate:** Review model relationships, API surface completeness, auth guards.

---

### Phase 4a — DB Schema

```
/phase4a-db-schema all | <MODEL_NAME>
```

**Example:** `/phase4a-db-schema all` or `/phase4a-db-schema User`

Agent: Backend Engineer | Skill: `MODULE_TEMPLATE` (Step 1) | Reads: `docs/architecture.md` (data models + ERD) | Output: `prisma/schema/[entity].prisma` files

Generates all Prisma schema files from the architecture doc's data models, defines all relations, and runs `npx prisma generate`. Run with `all` to process every model in dependency order.

**Gate:** All FK references resolve, relations are consistent on both sides, `prisma generate` succeeds.

---

### Phase 4b — Backend Module Generation

```
/phase4b-backend-modules <MODULE_NAME> | all
```

**Example:** `/phase4b-backend-modules AUTH` or `/phase4b-backend-modules all`

Agent: Backend Engineer | Skill: `MODULE_TEMPLATE` | Reads: `docs/brd.md` (module section), `docs/architecture.md` | Output: module code

Requires Phase 4a to be complete. Generates Zod schemas, routes, controllers, and middleware — using the already-generated Prisma client. Pass a module name for one module, or `all` to generate every module in dependency order.

**Gate:** ⚠️ VERIFY — Zod schemas become the frontend's source of truth. After the **first** module, run `/phase12-review` before generating more.

---

### Phase 5 — Backend Testing

```
/phase5-backend-testing <MODULE_NAME> | all
```

**Example:** `/phase5-backend-testing AUTH` or `/phase5-backend-testing all`

Agent: QA Engineer | Skill: `TESTING_CONVENTIONS` | Reads: `docs/brd.md` (acceptance criteria), Phase 4b module code, `docs/architecture.md`

Generates behavioral unit tests, integration tests, and Zod validation tests. Pass a module name for one module, or `all` to test every module. If `skills/TESTING_CONVENTIONS.md` doesn't exist yet, this phase creates it.

**Gate:** Run tests. Confirm they pass AND the test quality is good.

---

### Phase 6 — Database Migrations & Seed Data

```
/phase6-migrations
```

Agent: Backend Engineer | Skill: `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE` | Reads: `docs/brd.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, Phase 4a schemas, Phase 4b modules

Auto-detects database type. **SQL:** generates migration scripts, rollback scripts, and seed data. **MongoDB:** skips migrations (Prisma handles schema), generates Prisma seed scripts for all models with per-environment data (dev/staging/test). Does not generate index verification scripts — `prisma db push` handles indexes.

**Gate:** SQL: migrations run up and down cleanly. MongoDB: seed data passes Zod validation, FK relationships are consistent.

---

### Phase 7 — UI/UX Design & Style Guide

```
/phase7-ui-design <optional: design rules>
```

**Examples:**
- `/phase7-ui-design` — generate designs using defaults
- `/phase7-ui-design mobile first, dark mode default`
- `/phase7-ui-design minimal sidebar`

**Before running:** drop any reference images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, etc.) into `docs/design-references/`. Phase 7 reads them automatically.

Agent: UI Designer | Reads: `docs/brd.md` (Page Manifest from user stories), `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/design-references/` | Output: `docs/ui-design.md`

Generates everything in a single file: the Style Guide (exact Tailwind classes, shadcn variants, hex colors), wireframes, user flows, component inventory, responsive behavior, and state designs. Automatically reads any images in `docs/design-references/` and extracts colors, typography, spacing, and component patterns — visual style only, never features. Custom design rules (e.g., "mobile first", "dark mode default") override extracted styles. Phase 9 also reads `docs/design-references/` as a visual consistency check when generating pages.

**Gate:** Does every page in the Page Manifest have a wireframe? Is every style guide rule specific enough to produce identical results across independently prompted pages?

---

### Phase 8 — Frontend API Modules

```
/phase8-frontend-api <MODULE_NAME>
```

**Example:** `/phase8-frontend-api AUTH`

Agent: Frontend Engineer | Skill: `API_STANDARD` | Reads: `docs/brd.md` (module section), Phase 4b Zod schemas, `docs/architecture.md`

Copies Zod schemas from backend, generates TypeScript types, endpoint configs, service layer, React Query hooks, and mock data factories for one module.

**Gate:** Do copied Zod schemas exactly match the backend?

---

### Phase 9 — Page Generation

```
/phase9-pages <PAGE_NAME>
```

**Example:** `/phase9-pages DashboardPage` or `/phase9-pages LoginPage`

Agent: Frontend Engineer | Reads: `docs/brd.md` (module section), `docs/ui-design.md` (wireframe + style guide), `docs/design-references/`, Phase 8 hooks/types

Builds one page at a time using Tailwind + shadcn/ui, following the style guide exactly. Reads `docs/design-references/` images as a visual consistency check. Implements all states: loading, empty, error, populated.

**Gate:** Does the page match the design? After the **first** page, run `/phase12-review` before generating more.

---

### Phase 10 — Frontend Testing

```
/phase10-frontend-testing <MODULE_OR_PAGE_NAME>
```

**Example:** `/phase10-frontend-testing DashboardPage`

Agent: QA Engineer | Skill: `TESTING_CONVENTIONS` | Reads: `docs/brd.md` (acceptance criteria), Phase 9 page, Phase 8 mock data

Generates behavioral component tests, hook tests, form validation tests, and accessibility tests.

**Gate:** Run tests. Confirm they pass AND the test quality is good.

---

### Phase 11 — Integration & E2E Testing

```
/phase11-e2e
```

Agent: QA Engineer | Skill: `E2E_PATTERNS` | Reads: `docs/brd.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/ui-design.md`

Generates E2E test suites covering user flows, happy paths, error paths, cross-module integration, and auth flows.

**Gate:** All E2E flows pass against a running backend.

---

### Phase 12 — Code Review (Rolling)

```
/phase12-review <optional: what to review>
```

**Examples:**

- `/phase12-review first backend module AUTH`
- `/phase12-review full backend track`
- `/phase12-review first frontend page DashboardPage`
- `/phase12-review` (auto-detects checkpoint based on progress)

Agent: Software Architect | Skill: `REVIEW_CHECKLIST` | Reads: `docs/brd.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, relevant code

Reviews code for security, performance, consistency, missing pieces, and API contract alignment. Run this at checkpoints — not just at the end.

**Gate:** All critical issues resolved before proceeding.

---

### Phase 13 — Documentation

```
/phase13-docs
```

Agent: Technical Writer | Skill: `DOC_TEMPLATES` | Reads: `docs/brd.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, Phase 4b Zod schemas

Generates README, API docs, environment variable docs, onboarding guide, and architecture decision records.

**Gate:** Does the README setup actually work? Do API doc examples match reality?

---

### Phase 14 — Deployment Configuration

```
/phase14-deployment
```

Agent: DevOps Engineer | Skill: `INFRA_STANDARD` | Reads: `docs/brd.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, Phase 13 docs

Generates Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, CI/CD pipeline, env templates, health checks, and production deployment checklist.

**Gate:** Does Docker Compose work locally? Does CI/CD match your infrastructure?

---

## Workflow Order

```
Phase 1 — BRD (VERIFY)
  └── Phase 2 — Planning
        └── Phase 3 — Architecture
              ├── Backend Track:  Phase 4a → 4b → 5 → 6    (can run in parallel with Phase 7)
              └── Design Track:   Phase 7
                                        ↘
              Both tracks complete → Phase 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14
```

After Phase 3, the backend track and design track can run in parallel (two separate Claude Code sessions).

**Backend track order:** Phase 4a generates all Prisma models first → Phase 4b generates modules one by one against the stable schema.

---

## Code Review Checkpoints

Run `/phase12-review` at these points — don't wait until the end:

| When                                | Why                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| After first backend module (4b)     | Catch pattern-level issues before generating more modules |
| After backend track (Phases 4a-6)   | Cross-module consistency, migration correctness           |
| After first frontend page           | Catch UI pattern issues before generating more pages      |
| After frontend track (Phases 8-10)  | Cross-page consistency, API contract alignment            |
| After E2E (Phase 11)                | Final security + performance sweep                        |

---

## Skills

Skills are reusable reference documents encoding your conventions. They survive across projects and improve over time.

| Skill                      | Status                         | Used In           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `BRD_FORMAT.md`            | ✅ Ready                       | Phase 1           |
| `MODULE_TEMPLATE.md`       | ✅ Ready                       | Phase 4a, 4b      |
| `API_STANDARD.md`          | ✅ Ready                       | Phase 8           |
| `ARCHITECTURE_STANDARD.md` | Created by Phase 3             | Phase 3, 4a, 4b, 12 |
| `TESTING_CONVENTIONS.md`   | Created by Phase 5             | Phase 5, 10       |
| Style Guide (in `ui-design.md`) | Created per-project by Phase 7 | Phase 9      |
| `MIGRATION_TEMPLATE.md`    | Add when ready                 | Phase 6           |
| `E2E_PATTERNS.md`          | Add when ready                 | Phase 11          |
| `REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`      | Add when ready                 | Phase 12          |
| `DOC_TEMPLATES.md`         | Add when ready                 | Phase 13          |
| `INFRA_STANDARD.md`        | Add when ready                 | Phase 14          |

Skills you don't have yet won't block you — the phase commands handle missing skills gracefully. After your first project, extract patterns from what worked into new skill docs.

---

## Extending

**Add a skill:** Create a `.md` file in `skills/` (Purpose → Rules → Templates → Examples → Anti-patterns). The relevant phase command will pick it up automatically.

**Add a agent:** Create a `.md` file in `agents/` (Identity → Perspective → Priorities → What You Produce → What You Do Not Do).

**Refine over time:** When you correct the AI's output, note what you changed. If the same correction happens twice, add a rule to the relevant skill doc.
