# Business Requirements Document

<!--
Generated by: Phase 1 — Business Requirements (/phase1-brd)
Agent: Business Analyst

Content will include:
- Project overview and objectives
- User roles and agents
- User stories (As a / I want to / So that), each mapped to a module and page
- Page Manifest table (page, user stories, route)
- Functional requirements grouped by module (with requirement IDs)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Error states and edge cases per functional requirement
- Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then) for each requirement
- Assumptions and constraints
- Out of scope items

This document is the anchor for all downstream phases.
Do not edit directly after Phase 1 — use /phase-change to log requirement changes.
