Produce a structured summary of the current conversation session to preserve context before it is compacted.

## Session Summary

### What was accomplished
List every completed action, phase, or task in this session — be specific about what was produced, not just "Phase N complete."

### Files created or modified
List all file paths. Group by category:
- `docs/` — project artifacts
- `prisma/` — schema and seed files
- Backend source files
- Frontend source files
- Test files
- Config and deployment files

### Key values established
List concrete values any future phase or fresh context would need:
- Module and entity names
- Route paths and HTTP methods
- Schema field names and types
- Auth strategy and middleware names
- Naming conventions adopted
- Any constants or config values defined

### Decisions made
List architectural or design decisions — include the reason if known.

### Current state
- Last completed phase or task
- What is in progress (if anything)
- What comes next in the workflow

This summary is designed to be compact enough to carry forward as context after the conversation history is compressed.
