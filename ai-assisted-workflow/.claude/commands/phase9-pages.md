Adopt the agent defined in `agents/frontend-engineer.md`. Read it now before proceeding.

Read these context files before proceeding:
- BRD: `docs/brd.md` — focus on the relevant module requirements for: $ARGUMENTS
- UI Design: `docs/ui-design.md` — the wireframe for this specific page AND the Style Guide section (Section 1) for all styling decisions
- The frontend API module from Phase 8 — hook signatures, types, mock data factories
- Design references: check `docs/design-references/` for any image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif`) and read them. Use these as a visual consistency check when implementing the page — the generated UI should reflect the same visual style extracted from these images in Phase 7.

## Determine scope

If `$ARGUMENTS` is **"all"** (case-insensitive), generate **every** page listed in the BRD's **Page Manifest** table. Process them in order as they appear in the manifest. Otherwise, generate only the page for **$ARGUMENTS**.

For **each** page in scope, perform ALL of the following steps:

Build the page for **$ARGUMENTS**:
- Implement the layout matching the wireframe from `docs/ui-design.md`
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, following the Style Guide section of `docs/ui-design.md` exactly
- Use shadcn/ui components where applicable
- Import and use the generated hooks from Phase 8 for data fetching
- Use mock data for development/preview
- Implement all states: loading, empty, error, populated
- Include form validation using the frontend Zod schemas
- Implement responsive behavior per the Style Guide
- Follow Page Integration Rules from API_STANDARD.md Step 5 and Step 6:
  - Use Zod types directly — no intermediate row/item types
  - Put display helpers in reusable utility files, not inline

📋 REVIEW GATE: Does the page match the wireframe? Are Tailwind classes and shadcn components consistent with the Style Guide? Do all states render correctly? Compare against previously generated pages for visual consistency.

💡 After completing the FIRST page, run `/phase12-review` to catch pattern-level issues before generating more pages.

## Log Progress

After completing this phase, update `docs/progress.md`:

1. If `docs/progress.md` does not exist, create it with this header:
   ```
   # Project Progress

   | Phase | Name | Scope | Status | Date | Notes |
   |-------|------|-------|--------|------|-------|
   ```
2. Append one row per completed page (fill in today's date and a one-line summary):
   `| 9 | Pages | {PAGE_NAME} | ✅ Complete | YYYY-MM-DD | {summary} |`
